## System Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **API Integration**: Axios
- **Charts & Visualization**: Chart.js

### Backend

- **Framework**: NestJS

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL (v15 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized setup)

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your database credentials

# Run database migrations
npm run migration:run

# Start the development server
npm run start:dev
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your backend API URL

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Database Setup

The application uses PostgreSQL. You can set it up locally or use Docker:

```bash
# Using Docker Compose in the backend directory
cd backend
docker-compose up -d
```

## Core Business Model

### Running Month Billing

This application uses a "running month" billing model:

1. **Full Month Billing**:

   - Tenants pay for the FULL month regardless of move-in or move-out date
   - No proration is applied for partial month occupancy
   - If a tenant leaves mid-month, they are still responsible for the entire month's bill

2. **Bill Generation**:

   - Bills are automatically generated at the beginning of each month (1st day at 00:01)
   - Billing cycle is calendar month-based (1st to end of month)

3. **Tenant Closure Process**:

   - When a tenant is leaving, they are charged for the full current month
   - The final settlement applies advance payments first, then security deposit
   - Security deposits are only used for the final settlement, not for regular billing

4. **Payment Handling**:
   - Overpayments are stored as advance payments and carry over to future bills
   - Security deposits are separate from advance payments and only used at checkout
